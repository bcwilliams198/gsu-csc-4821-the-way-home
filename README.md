# The Way Home
_The Way Home_ is a browser-based, 2d-platforming video game created during the Fall 2021 semester at Georgia State University for Dr. Michael Weeks's Fundamentals of Game Design (CSC 4821) course.  
This project was a collaborative effort between four undergraduate [students](#authors--contributions) and was submitted for the course's final assignment along with a [video](https://youtu.be/Dy2eZXNsMgg) that was presented to the class on the final day of the course.

### Synopsis
_The Way Home_'s plot features an unnamed alien who must traverse a sector of Area 51 in order to retrieve his confiscated airship and return to his home planet. The player assumes control of the alien to jump onto platforms, fight against military guards, and escape the facility unharmed.

The game's engine was designed and implemented entirely from scratch via vanilla JavaScript and HTML5, intended to be a demonstration of the convenience and versatility of JavaScript as an all-purpose, high-level programming language, as well as fulfill the project requirement of running in a browser without downloads.

A poster was presented at the Georgia State Undergraduate Research Conference in the following Spring semester:
